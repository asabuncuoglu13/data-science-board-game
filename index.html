Okay, maybe we do not want to rule the world but if you want to create a great impact on society, you need to understand the habits of the society. We are talking about more than 6 billion people! You can’t meet with all of these people. So, you need to interpret lines and lines of XLS or CSV files. What are these files? Well, you will learn…' +

    <p>Problems can be serious or fun. In the world of data, we are solving some fun problems like predicting what will
        be the next generation of music and serious problems like finding a way to access clear water. The
        modern methods like examining the data and see the solution behind this data can be the best way to approach
        these problems.</p>
